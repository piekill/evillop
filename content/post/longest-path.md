### Longest-path, by Daniel Barrett.
Woh, oh-oh-oh

Find the longest path

Woh, oh-oh-oh

Find the longest path

If you said P is NP tonight

There would still be papers left to write

I have a weakness

I'm addicted to completeness

And I keep searching for the longest path


The algorithm I would like to see

Is of polynomial degree

Buts it's elusive,

Nobody has found conclusive

Evidence that we can find a longest path

I have been hard-working for so long

I swear its right, but he marks it wrong

Somehow I'll feel sorry when it's done

GPA 2.1,
Is more than I hoped for

Garey, Johnson, Karp and other men (and women too)

Try to make it *O(n log n)*.

Am I a mad fool

If I spend my life in grad school

Forever following the longest path.

Woh, oh-oh-oh

Find the longest path

Woh, oh-oh-oh

Find the longest path
