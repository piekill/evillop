*   Nothing to do with your English. (?)

Structure: how to organize your talk
------------------------------------

*   A single thesis statement
    *   Everything supports your thesis
*   Make your talk prefix-competitive
*   _Put your results up front_
*   Say what you did, why you did it, but not how you did it
*   Give your results multiple times at different levels/granularities
*   Begin a talk: explain your title
*   Show scholarship
    *   how does your work fit into the rest of the world? (_Solved an important open problem_)
*   Go deep rather than board
*   How to prepare: explain your talk to others
*   View your talk as a tree traversal

How your slides should look like
--------------------------------

*   slide deck/slides should be self contained
*   slide should have a point and a conclusion
*   nearly every slide should have a picture/example
*   the last slide should convey what you want people to see at the end

Hint to Deliver Your Talk
-------------------------

*   Keeping people’s attention
*   People only pay attention to one thing at a time
*   Looking at people’s faces. Stand by the screen, point and touch the screen.
*   _Conclude your slide_
*   Tell personal stories (be careful)
*   Smile
*   Should you read your slides?
    *   Should be a super set
*   Tell a joke
    *   commit to your joke yourself
    *   explain it the way that audience know when to laugh
*   Don’t apologize

### How to present graphs
